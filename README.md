## About Me 🦖

I've dedicated myself to learning data engineering with a passion for several months now, and I find it incredibly rewarding. My path in this field has been shaped by the immersive bootcamp program at Alterra Academy, where I've gained invaluable guidance and knowledge.
- **Data Engineering:** 🔧 Proficient in various data engineering concepts, including data processing, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines, data warehousing, and more.
- **Programming Languages:** 🛠️ Skilled in Python, SQL, and other relevant programming languages for data engineering tasks.
- **Tools and Technologies:** ⚔️ Experienced with tools like Apache Spark, Apache Kafka, Apache Airflow, SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), and cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP).
- **Interest:** 📐 Deeply interested in exploring advanced data engineering techniques, optimizing data pipelines for scalability and efficiency, and staying updated with the latest trends in the field.

I am enthusiastic about leveraging my skills and knowledge to tackle real-world data challenges and contribute meaningfully to the field of data engineering.

## Projects ⚙️

Here are some highlights of the projects I've worked on. Each project includes a brief description and a link to the repository.

1. **Capstone Project (Inventory Aging)** 🖥️
   - Description: In the inventory aging project, I led the orchestration of the Airflow Ingestion Workflow, managing tasks such as configuring Docker, crafting DAG scripts, and overseeing Extract and Load Processes. Collaborating with my team, we utilized DBT for configuring profiles and leveraged Metabase for efficient data visualization. Our objective was to deliver meticulously curated, user-friendly data models tailored specifically for the project, aiming to provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory management and financial performance.

2. **Birth Dynamics in Japan** 👶
   - Description: This ongoing project focuses on analyzing birth demographics in Japan by harnessing a dataset obtained through Airbyte, processed via dbt within an Apache Airflow workflow, and visualized using Metabase. Employing an Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) approach, I oversee the transformation process from raw data to insightful visualizations. By integrating Airbyte for data ingestion, dbt for transformation, and Metabase for visualization within an Apache Airflow workflow, I ensure seamless data processing and visualization, facilitating in-depth analysis of birth demographics in Japan.
